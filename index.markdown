I am a rising senior at Harvard, studying statistics and computer science (CSE).
I'm currently a research assistant in the [Huttenhower
Lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/), where I build tools to analyze
microbiome data. I'm broadly interested in applications of statistics and
computer science to biological and social sciences problems.
