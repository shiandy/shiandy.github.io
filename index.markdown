I am a rising senior at Harvard, studying statistics and computer science
([CSE](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/computational-science-and-engineering/master-of-science-in-cse)).
I'm currently a research assistant in the [Huttenhower
Lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/), where I build tools to analyze
microbiome data. I'm broadly interested in applications of statistics and
computer science to biological and social sciences problems.
