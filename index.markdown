I am a senior at Harvard College, studying statistics and computer science
([CSE](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/computational-science-and-engineering/master-of-science-in-cse)).
I'm currently a research assistant in the [Huttenhower
Lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/), where I build computational and
statistical tools to analyze microbiome data. I'm broadly interested in
developing statistical methods with applications in biology.
